# three-little-grails

Let's implement the (once) Holy Grail 🏆 of web layout... 3 ways (**there are 3 corresponding directories already in this repository**):

1. [Like the Dr. Johnsons do](https://allover.twodee.org/flexbox/holy-grail/)
    * flexbox
    * not responsive
1. Like the Mozillans do: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Realizing_common_layouts_using_grids
    * css grid
    * responsive: 3 experiences
1. JMU CS Style
    * improve on The Mozillans' to provide 4 experiences. in the 4th, which will be at 256px viewport width and below, show only the "Main article area"
